# Setting up your story repo

You've created your own **private** copy of this template. Three one-time
steps and you're reading. ~10 minutes.

## 0. Prerequisites

- A GitHub account (free is fine).
- A Claude Pro or Max subscription — the story-writing workflow runs on
  *your* subscription via an OAuth token; there is no shared backend.
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) installed locally (only
  needed once, to mint the token).

## 1. Reader access token

The reader web page at <https://cgaisl.github.io/elephant-stories/> needs
read access to this private repo:

1. GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Fine-grained personal access
   tokens → *Generate new token*
2. Repository access: **Only select repositories** → this repo
3. Repository permissions: **Contents → Read-only** (nothing else)
4. Open the reader page, enter `yourname/your-repo` and paste the token.
   Both are stored only in your browser. Tip: bookmark
   `https://cgaisl.github.io/elephant-stories/?repo=yourname/your-repo`
   and the repo field prefills itself on a new device.

## 2. Claude GitHub App

In a local Claude Code terminal run `/install-github-app`, or install
manually at <https://github.com/apps/claude>, and grant it this repo.

## 3. Subscription token for the workflow

```sh
claude setup-token
```

Copy the token it prints, then: repo → Settings → Secrets and variables →
Actions → *New repository secret* → name `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, value =
the token.

## 4. Onboard yourself

Open an issue on this repo (or use the reader's request button) mentioning
`@claude`, and introduce yourself: your level, whether you can read the
script yet, where you live, what you want from the stories. The tutor fills
in `PROFILE.md`, seeds the vocabulary ledger, and writes your first story as
an issue comment. From then on, every request is just an issue away.

To confirm everything is wired up, the reader's ⚙ settings screen has a
**Check setup** button that verifies your repo, token, and the story-writing
workflow. (It can't see the Claude App installation or the repo secret —
those only show up when your first `@claude` issue gets answered, under the
repo's **Actions** tab.)

Note on usage accounting: automated runs may draw from a separate monthly
credit pool included with your subscription rather than interactive session
limits — check <https://platform.claude.com/settings/usage> if curious.
